An "on-board charger" in an electric vehicle (EV) is a device integrated within the car that converts alternating current (AC) power from a standard power outlet into direct current (DC) power needed to charge the vehicle's battery, essentially allowing the EV to be recharged from a regular household electrical source; it is a key component for convenient charging at home or public charging stations. 
The charging point ratio is the number of electric vehicles (EVs) per charging station. The ideal ratio varies depending on factors like the type of EV, geography, and urbanization.
